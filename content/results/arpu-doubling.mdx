### Challenge

This subscription product in the EMEA region suffered from low average revenue per user. With a fixed marketing budget and stable customer acquisition cost (CAC), the goal was to unlock value from the existing base.

### Approach

We segmented users by intent and purchase history, launched tailored acquisition campaigns on Google Ads (Performance Max and Display), iterated landing pages weekly, and implemented retention levers such as targeted offers and loyalty perks. Automations in n8n orchestrated the flow between ad platforms, CRM, and analytics, while AI tools helped ideate creatives.

### Outcome

Within 90 days the average revenue per user more than doubled (+95–120%), while CAC remained stable. This uplift came from higher conversion rates, increased lifetime value, and lower churn. The process can be replicated across other subscription products.
