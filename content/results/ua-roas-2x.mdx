### Challenge

An e‑commerce retailer in the mid‑market struggled with low return on ad spend (ROAS) hovering around 1.1. The goal was to double the efficiency of media spend without sacrificing volume.

### Approach

We implemented a rigorous creative testing cadence, iterating ad copy and visuals weekly based on performance insights. Product feeds were optimised to include richer attributes and segmented by margin tiers. AI tools suggested headlines and value propositions. Performance data was streamed into dashboards to inform rapid pivots.

### Outcome

Within ten weeks ROAS climbed from roughly 1.1 to 2.2 while maintaining revenue volume. The systematic test‑and‑learn approach provided a repeatable playbook for the marketing team.
