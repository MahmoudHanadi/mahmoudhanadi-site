### Challenge

Launching carrier billing across multiple jurisdictions requires navigating complex regulatory frameworks, integrating with numerous carrier systems, and coordinating marketing roll‑outs.

### Approach

The initiative started with mapping regulatory requirements country by country and engaging legal counsel to ensure compliance. Carriers were prioritised based on market potential and negotiation leverage. We established a repeatable integration process, leveraging automation scripts to minimise manual work, and aligned marketing calendars with carrier launch windows.

### Outcome

Within a year we launched carrier billing in six markets. Each launch was fully compliant and delivered predictable conversion rates. The process created a template that can be used for additional markets.
