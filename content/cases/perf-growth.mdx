## Challenge

An established e‑commerce brand faced plateauing return on ad spend across its paid media channels. Marketing leadership needed a plan to unlock incremental growth without ballooning budgets.

## What I did as Leader

- Set a clear north‑star metric (ROAS) and aligned cross‑functional teams around it.
- Established an experimentation roadmap prioritising creative and feed tests.
- Coached the marketing team on data‑driven decision making and rapid iteration.

## What I did Hands‑on

- Built dynamic creative templates to accelerate testing cycles.
- Analysed feed performance and restructured product data for better relevance.
- Configured dashboards to visualise ROAS and attribute lifts.

## Outcome

The structured programme doubled ROAS in ten weeks while preserving revenue. The playbook has since been reused across other categories.
